                <p>Boba tea has been stirred up all over New York City for the past year and can be found at an estabilisahed chain or locally owned shop. The drink was originallly invented in the 1980s in tea shops in Taichung, Taiwan. As in the name, most boba tea drinks contain a tea base mixed with fruit flavor or milk. The fun of this drink comes from the small chewy tapioca balls, also known as boba, which is why it is sometimes called “the drink with the fat straw”. Below are some of the best boba tea shops in New York City, according to Time Out's list of best places to get boba tea in NYC.</p>
