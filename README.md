# Best Boba Tea Shops | Midterm Project

## Ontology
* Domain: Best boba tea shops in NYC
* Classes: Boba Guys, Gong Cha, and Bar Pa Tea
* Relationships: Each class has a name, introduction, names of popular drinks, and a photo

## Taxonomy
* "Best Boba Tea Shops" is used as an h1 in both pages, which is what the website is about.
* "About" and "Popular Drinks" are used as an h3 to gave an introduction of each store and talk about each store's most popular drinks.

## Choreography
* The small introduction comes first on the second page to introduce what boba tea is.
* The order of the stores is Boba Guys, Gong Cha, and then Bar Pa Tea because this is based on the order of Time Out's list of best boba tea shops in NYC. Boba Guys is ranked first, followed by Gong Cha, and then Bar Pa Tea.

## Z-Pattern 
* Primary Quadrant: "Best Boba Tea Shops" is there so the user will know what the website will be about.
* Strong Quadrant: Form to sign up for a newsletter is there so the user can enter their email and sign up. Signing up for a newsletter is the secondary goal so it is placed here instead of the terminal quadrant.
* Center: There is an image of boba tea to show the user what it looks like while guiding them to the bottom of the page.
* Weak Quadrant: There is a phrase about boba tea to make the user curious about it so they will turn their attention to the terminal quadrant.
* Terminal Quadrant: There are words telling the user to "click here" because that is the primary goal of the website, to get the user to read more about boba tea.

## F-Pattern 
* "Best Boba Tea Shops" is on the top left so the user know what he/she will read about
* The form to sign up for a newsletter is on the top right so the user has another chance to sign up
* There is a short paragraph right below to give an overview of what boba tea is
* The left side of the page is the name of each store which is what the user will see when they look from top to bottom
* When the user reads from left to right, they will see information about the store and the store's most popular drinks, and a photo of a drink from each store

## C.R.A.P. Principles
* Contrast: The text on the webstie is black and the background is a caramel color to make the text stand out. Black and caramel color are used because black represents the boba while the caramel color is the milk tea.
* Repetition: The h1 on both pages are the same font and size. Each h2 and h3 are the same size and font to create a unified look on the page.
* Alignment: The paragraphs underneath each h3 are aligned the same way to make it easier to read.
* Proximity: Each paragraph is right underneath the h3 to show their relationship. Each caption is right below the image to show that they are describing the drink in the photo.

## Fonts
* "Varela Round" is used for the h1 because the roundess of the font matches the look of boba. The fact that it is sans-serif also makes it look less traditional and more modern.
* "Lato" is used for all of the other text because it is modern looking which matches well with the content of the website since boba tea is a modern and trendy drink.

## CSS Architecture
* The CSS strategy that was used is SMACSS
* Each CSS file represents a different section from the SMACSS structure
